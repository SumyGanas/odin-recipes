    <h2> Description: </h2>
        <p> 
        This vanilla cake recipe is great for all occasions and easy to make. 
        It's the best cake I have ever made. It's not too bland, and it's not too sweet. 
        Slice the cooled cake through the middle to make two layers and frost as desired.
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> cooking spray  </li>
            <li> 2/⅔ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed </li>
            <li> 1 cup white sugar  </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon baking powder </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract </li>
            <li> 2 pinches salt </li>
            <li> 3 eggs </li>
            <li> ¾ cup milk </li>
            <li> ¾ cup vegetable oil </li>
        </ul>

    <h2> Steps: </h2>
        <ol>
        <li> 
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Grease a 9-inch cake tin with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.</p>
        </li>  
        <li>
           <p> Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt together in a large bowl.
            Add eggs, milk, and vegetable oil; 
            mix by hand or beat with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth.
            Add more flour if batter is too runny. Pour into the prepared pan.</p>
        </li> 
        <li>
           <p> Bake in the preheated oven until a 
            toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.
            Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
            Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert cake carefully onto a cooling rack.
            Let cool completely.</p>
        </li> 
        </ol>
