            Easy-to-make homemade chocolate pudding.
         </p>
    <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 3 cups whole milk, divided  </li>
            <li> ¼ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li> ⅓ cup white sugar, or more to taste </li>
            <li> 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips </li>
            <li> 1 pinch salt (Optional) </li>
        </ul>

    <h2> Steps: </h2>
        <ol>
        <li> 
            <p>Combine 1/2 cup milk and cornstarch in a small bowl. Whisk or stir with a fork until smooth and all lumps have been incorporated. </p>
        </li>  
        <li>
           <p> Combine remaining milk with sugar in a medium saucepan over low heat. Slowly whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Cook, whisking as needed to prevent lumps from forming, until mixture begins to thicken, 8 to 10 minutes. Add chocolate chips and salt. Continue stirring until chips are completely melted and pudding is smooth and thickened, about 7 minutes more.</p>
        </li> 
        <li>
           <p> Pour pudding into 1 large bowl or 6 individual bowls. Place plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming; smooth it gently against the surface. Refrigerate for at least 3 to 4 hours before serving.</p>

        </ol>
